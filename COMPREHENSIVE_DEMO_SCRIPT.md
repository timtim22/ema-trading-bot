## **PART 1: Strategy & System Architecture Overview** *(5-7 minutes)*

### **Opening Hook** *(30 seconds)*
> *"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to show you our automated EMA trading bot in action. This system has been executing real trades and I'll walk you through exactly how it works, what you're seeing in development, and how it scales to production."*

### **1.1 Trading Strategy Explanation** *(2 minutes)*

**Show:** Dashboard with EMA chart visible

**Script:**
> *"Let me start with the core strategy. We're using Exponential Moving Averages - specifically the 5, 8, and 22-period EMAs you see here as the three colored lines on the chart."*

**[Point to chart lines and candlesticks]**

> *"The blue line is EMA-5 (fastest), orange is EMA-8 (medium), and red is EMA-22 (slowest). The magic happens when the faster EMA-5 crosses above the slower EMA-8, while both are above the EMA-22. This indicates strong upward momentum."*

> *"You can also see the actual price action in these candlestick bars - each bar represents the full price range for that time period. Green bars show the price went up, red bars show it went down. The volume bars below show how much trading activity accompanied each price movement."*

**Development Note:**
> *"What you're seeing now is live market data from Alpaca's API. In development, we're using their sandbox environment with real market feeds but paper trading. In production, this connects to real brokerage accounts."*

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- ✅ **3-bar confirmation** prevents false signals
- ✅ **Only trades during market hours** (9:30 AM - 4 PM EST)
- ✅ **Holiday detection** prevents weekend/holiday trading
- ✅ **Risk management** built into every trade

### **1.2 System Architecture** *(2 minutes)*

**Show:** Switch between dashboard tabs (Settings, Positions, Signals)

**Script:**
> *"The system architecture is built for reliability and scalability:"*

**Current Development Setup:**
- **Frontend:** Real-time dashboard with WebSocket connections
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails with background job processing
- **Data:** Live market feeds via Alpaca API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for trade history and configurations

**Production Differences:**
> *"In production, we add Redis for caching, load balancers for high availability, and encrypted API connections. The core logic remains identical - what you see working here will work exactly the same in production."*

### **1.3 Risk Management Philosophy** *(1-2 minutes)*

**Show:** Settings panel with profit/loss configurations

**Script:**
> *"Risk management is paramount. Every trade has predefined exit points:"*

- **Fixed trade amount:** $1,000 per position (configurable)
- **Take profit:** Currently set to 2% (configurable)
- **Stop loss:** Currently set to 0.5% (configurable)
- **Maximum positions:** Prevents over-exposure

> *"These settings can be adjusted per user in production, allowing different risk profiles for different accounts."*

---

## **PART 2: Live System Demonstration** *(8-10 minutes)*

### **2.1 Real-Time Data & Market Monitoring** *(2 minutes)*

**Action:** Navigate to main dashboard

**Script:**
> *"Let's start with what you're seeing right now. This is live market data for TSLA updating every few seconds."*

**[Point to specific elements:]**

**Current Market Data:**
- **Price:** *[Point to current price in top status bar: $348.2]* "This is the real-time stock price"
- **Price Candlesticks:** *[Point to green/red price bars]* "Each bar shows the open, high, low, and close prices for the time period - green for price increases, red for decreases"
- **Volume:** *[Point to volume bars at bottom]* "These gray bars show trading volume - how many shares are being traded"
- **EMAs:** *[Point to chart lines]* "These three lines are recalculating with every price update - EMA-5 in blue, EMA-8 in orange, EMA-22 in red"
- **Real-time Updates:** *[Point to "Last Update" timestamp]* "Notice all data updates every few seconds"

**Development vs Production:**
> *"In development, we're pulling data every 30 seconds. In production, we can increase this to real-time tick data for institutional clients or keep it at 1-minute intervals for retail clients."*

### **2.2 Signal Detection & Execution** *(3 minutes)*

**Action:** Run signal test script or wait for natural signal

**Script:**
> *"Now let me show you signal detection in action. I'll generate a test signal to demonstrate the complete workflow."*

**[Run the test script in terminal:]**
```bash
rails runner 'load "script/test_signals_with_ui.rb"'
```

**As the script runs, narrate:**

> *"Watch the 'Recent Trading Signals' section. When the system detects an EMA crossover, several things happen simultaneously:"*

1. **Signal Creation:** *[Point to new signal appearing]*
2. **Real-time Notification:** *[Point to any notifications]*
3. **Automatic Position Creation:** *[Navigate to Active Positions]*
4. **Risk Level Setup:** *[Point to Take Profit/Stop Loss values]*

**Key Differentiator:**
> *"Notice the speed - from signal detection to position creation happens in milliseconds. In production, this connects directly to brokerage APIs for instant execution."*

### **2.3 Position Management & Tracking** *(2 minutes)*

**Show:** Active Positions table with the newly created position

**Script:**
> *"Here's our position management system. For each active trade, you can see:"*

- **Entry Price:** Where we bought the stock
- **Current Price:** Live market value
- **P/L Percentage:** Real-time profit/loss calculation
- **Take Profit Level:** Automatic sell point for profits
- **Stop Loss Level:** Automatic sell point to limit losses

**Live Demo:**
> *"Watch this P/L percentage update in real-time as the stock price moves. This is exactly what traders would see in production."*

**Development Note:**
> *"The position you're seeing uses our current settings - 2% take profit, 0.5% stop loss. In production, each client can have different risk parameters."*

### **2.4 Settings & Configuration** *(2 minutes)*

**Show:** Settings panel

**Script:**
> *"Let me show you the flexibility of the system. I'll change our risk parameters in real-time."*

**[Change settings to 4.0% profit, 1.0% loss]**

**[Run test script again]**

> *"Now watch - the new position will use the updated settings."*

**[Point to new position with different Take Profit/Stop Loss values]**

**Production Scaling:**
> *"In production, we can have:"*
- **Multi-user configurations:** Each client has custom settings
- **Symbol-specific parameters:** Different risk levels per stock
- **Time-based adjustments:** More aggressive during volatile periods
- **Account size scaling:** Larger accounts can handle bigger positions

### **2.5 Error Handling & Reliability** *(1 minute)*

**Script:**
> *"Let me briefly show you our error handling. The system is designed to fail gracefully."*

**Show:** Stop the bot, show status changes

> *"Notice how the system clearly shows status changes, maintains data integrity, and can be restarted without losing any information."*

**Production Reliability:**
> *"In production, we add automatic failover, data backups, and 24/7 monitoring. The system is designed for 99.9% uptime."*

## **Q&A Handling Guide**

### **Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "How does this perform during market volatility?"**
**A:** *"Great question. The 3-bar confirmation specifically helps during volatile periods by filtering out noise. We can also adjust the confirmation period - more bars for stability, fewer for responsiveness."*

**Q: "What happens if the internet connection fails?"**
**A:** *"The system has multiple safeguards. In production, we use redundant connections and automatic failover. Any open positions remain protected by the brokerage's risk management systems."*

**Q: "Can this be customized for different trading strategies?"**
**A:** *"Absolutely. The EMA parameters, confirmation periods, and risk levels are all configurable. We can also implement completely different technical indicators using the same framework."*

**Q: "What are the ongoing costs?"**
**A:** *"Costs include cloud infrastructure (scales with usage), market data feeds (typically $50-200/month), and our licensing/support fees. We can provide detailed cost projections based on your expected trading volume."*

**Q: "How do you ensure data security?"**
**A:** *"Security is paramount. We use bank-grade encryption, secure API connections, and never store account credentials. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit."*
