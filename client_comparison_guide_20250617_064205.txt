============================================================
Generated: 2025-06-17 06:42:05 UTC

OVERVIEW:
--------
Even though our bot uses 'paper money' (simulation), the market data,
prices, and timing are 100% REAL and identical to live trading.

WHAT YOU CAN COMPARE:
--------------------

1. EXACT TIMESTAMPS & PRICES
   Our Log: '2025-06-17 14:30:15 UTC - TSLA @ $347.82'
   Your Platform: Check TSLA price at 2:30:15 PM UTC (9:30:15 AM EST)
   ✓ Prices should match within normal bid/ask spread

2. EMA CALCULATIONS
   Our Log: 'EMA-5: 348.15, EMA-8: 347.90, EMA-22: 346.50'
   Your Platform: Use any EMA indicator with same periods (5, 8, 22)
   ✓ Values should be identical (standard EMA formula)

3. SIGNAL TIMING
   Our Log: 'BULLISH CROSSOVER: EMA-5 crossed above EMA-8'
   Your Platform: Check if EMA-5 actually crossed EMA-8 at that time
   ✓ Crossover should be visible on your charts

4. MARKET CONDITIONS
   Our Log: 'Volume: 1,250,000, Volatility: 2.3%'
   Your Platform: Check volume and price movement at same time
   ✓ Market conditions should match
